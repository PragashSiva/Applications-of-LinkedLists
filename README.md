# Applications-of-LinkedLists
The project contains two independent uses of singly-linked lists:
1. Government use of linked lists to collect information of baby names, then delete/ insert, and search them.
2. Medical use of linked lists to collect drug information and properties and sort them 

Both files are written in C# and are currently programmed to accept raw data files which cannot be posted to public 
due to copyright issues.
